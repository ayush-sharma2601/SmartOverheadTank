# SmartOverheadTank
This is a Microprocessor based smart tank system in which the water level is maintained according to the time of the day. The water level should be maintained at three different values according to the time of the day.

## About the Project

1. The System controls water level in the smart overhead tank at 3 different levels according to
time throughout the day:
- 00:00am to 05:00am: Level 1 (Minimum Level)
- 05:00am to 06:00am: Level 2 (Nominal Level)
- 6:00am to 10:00am: Level 3 (Maximum Level)
- 10:00am to 5:00pm: Level 2 (Nominal Level)
- 5:00pm to 7:00pm: Level 3 (Maximum Level)
- 7:00pm to 00:00am: Level 2 (Nominal Level)
2. The level sensors used are non contact as the water is used for drinking/hosehold purposes.
3. The water in the main tank must be maintained at a constant value, if the level drops the motor is turned on
